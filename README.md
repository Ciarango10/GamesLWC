# Dashboard Documentation
## Components
Parent Component: Dashboard
Purpose: Serves as the main container for the dashboard and coordinates interactions between its child components.

## Child Component: Data Table
Purpose: Displays a list of game records in a tabular format, allowing users to view, edit and delete available games and select one for more details.

## Child Component: Record Detail

# Dashboard Overview and Use Cases
The dashboard is divided into two sections:

## Game List Section (Data Table): 
Displays a structured list of game records in a table format. Each row includes essential information (e.g., name, genre, platform) and buttons to view more details, edit and delete.
## Game Details Section (Record Detail): 
Dynamically updates to show detailed information about the selected game. When no game is selected, it displays a placeholder message.

# Use Cases
1. Game Exploration: Users can browse through a library of games to identify ones they are interested in.
2. Detailed Insights: Users can click on a game to view specific details, such as its release date or developer information.
3. Data-Driven Decisions: Enables users (e.g., game store managers) to analyze the game library for business purposes.
